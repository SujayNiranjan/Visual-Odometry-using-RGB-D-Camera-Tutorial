Visual Odometry using RGB-D Camera Tutorial
==============================================
**Author**: **Niranjan Sujay**


**Step 1: Introduction** 

Let's delve into Visual Odometry, a key element in computer vision and robotics, guided by Niranjan Sujay. This tutorial focuses on enabling robots to comprehend their surroundings by analyzing sequentially captured images. Visual Odometry plays a crucial role in helping robots understand their movements through onboard cameras.

   - Explore the mechanics of Visual Odometry, a fundamental component in robotic navigation and perception. Imagine a robot in an unknown environment figuring out its location merely by observing its surroundings. In this tutorial, we'll break down the steps and employ techniques to make Visual Odometry work.

   - In the realm of computer vision, Visual Odometry takes center stage, enabling robots to estimate their position and orientation by tracking features across consecutive images. From reading sensor data to processing color and depth images and implementing optical flow techniques, we cover each step in detail. The ultimate objective is to predict the robot's path and poseâ€”an essential aspect of autonomous navigation.

The tutorial will guide you through the entire process, from reading sensors to manipulating images and employing clever mathematics to track points over time, showcasing the practical utility of Visual Odometry.
